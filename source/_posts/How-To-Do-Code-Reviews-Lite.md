## Why

- Improve code quality and readable
- Share knowledge and coding skills
- Give constructive feedback to help teammates grow

Note: Lookers-on see more than players

## When

Completing the following points:

- Code Linting / Formatting (IDE)
- SonarQube Scan
- Automated Testing

## Principles 

- Does reviewer understand what the code does easily
- Does the code follow coding standards
- Review fewer than 30 minutes
- Check no more than 400 lines at a time
- Make sure the code is correct, security, simple and readable (not your way of doing it)
- Give feedback that helps face to face (No hurts or personal preference)

Note: There’s no such thing as perfect code
